    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <p>
      Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
      revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero
      characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept
      for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character
      likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of
      character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's]

      into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an
      active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward
      Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely
      felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of
      good versus evil".[4]

    <h3>21st century</h3>
    <p>
      When the Ultimate Marvel imprint was created with reimagined versions of
      Marvel's characters, an alternate Iron Man appeared in 2002 with the
      Ultimates, the imprint's adaptation of The Avengers.[50] A five issue
      limited series, Ultimate Iron Man, was released featuring this character
      in 2005.[51]

    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
    <p>
      Tony Stark inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, after his
      parents were killed in a car crash.[65] Developing equipment for the U.S.
      military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he
      triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he
      is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands that Stark build him a
      weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart,
      becoming Iron Man.[15][5]
